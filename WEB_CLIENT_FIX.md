# Web Client Build Fix Summary

## Problem
The original web client setup using `react-scripts` (Create React App) was not building successfully due to:
1. Outdated/incompatible package versions
2. Missing webpack configuration for TypeScript and protobuf code generation
3. Issues with generated protobuf code importing `.js` extensions

## Solution
Replaced `react-scripts` with a custom **webpack 5** build system with proper TypeScript and protobuf support.

## Files Modified

### 1. `web-client/package.json`
- **Removed:** `react-scripts`, old `@bufbuild/*` packages
- **Added:** 
  - `@connectrpc/connect` and `@connectrpc/connect-web` (latest gRPC-Web libraries)
  - Webpack 5 and related loaders
  - Updated React to 18.3.1
  - TypeScript 5.3.3
- **Updated scripts:**
  - `start`: Now uses `webpack serve`
  - `build`: Runs protobuf generation then webpack build

### 2. `web-client/webpack.config.js` (NEW)
Custom webpack configuration with:
- TypeScript compilation via `ts-loader`
- CSS processing
- HTML generation
- Development server with hot reload on port 3000
- **Critical fix:** `extensionAlias` to resolve `.js` imports to `.ts` files
- Production optimizations (code splitting, minification)

### 3. `web-client/tsconfig.json`
Updated for webpack compatibility:
- Target: ES2020
- Module: esnext
- `noEmit: false` (webpack handles output)
- Added `outDir` and `exclude` settings

### 4. `web-client/buf.gen.yaml`
Changed from remote to local plugins:
```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-es
    out: src/gen
    opt: target=ts
  - local: protoc-gen-connect-es
    out: src/gen
    opt: target=ts
```

### 5. `web-client/buf.yaml` (NEW)
Added workspace configuration for buf CLI.

### 6. `web-client/src/App.tsx`
Updated imports:
- `@bufbuild/connect-web` → `@connectrpc/connect-web`
- `@bufbuild/connect` → `@connectrpc/connect`

### 7. `Dockerfile.web`
Updated to:
- Install all dependencies (not just production)
- Copy webpack config and buf config files
- Run full npm build process

### 8. `scripts/build/build.mk`
- Removed duplicate target definitions
- Added `build-web-client` and `docker-build-web` targets

### 9. `scripts/test/test-web-client.sh`
Enhanced to test:
- Node.js and npm installation
- Dependency installation
- Protobuf generation
- **Webpack build process**
- Build artifact verification

## New Files Created

1. **`web-client/webpack.config.js`** - Webpack build configuration
2. **`web-client/buf.yaml`** - Buf workspace config
3. **`web-client/BUILD.md`** - Comprehensive build system documentation
4. **`web-client/.gitignore`** - Ignore node_modules, build artifacts, generated files

## Testing

### ✅ Build Test Results
```bash
$ make test-web-client
✓ Node.js v24.10.0 is available
✓ npm 11.6.0 is available
✓ Protobuf generation successful
✓ Generated TypeScript files are present
✓ Webpack build successful
✓ Build artifacts are present
✓ Web client setup test completed successfully!
```

### Build Output
```
build/
├── index.html                           # 526 bytes
├── main.[contenthash].js                # 201 KB (minified)
├── main.[contenthash].js.map            # 743 KB (source map)
└── main.[contenthash].js.LICENSE.txt    # 971 bytes
```

## Usage

### Development Mode
```bash
make dev-web-client
# Opens http://localhost:3000 with hot reload
```

### Production Build
```bash
make build-web-client
# Creates optimized build in web-client/build/
```

### Docker Build
```bash
make docker-build-web
# Builds nginx image serving the React app
```

### Full Stack
```bash
make up
# Starts all services + web client on http://localhost:8080
```

## Key Technical Fixes

### 1. Extension Resolution
**Problem:** Generated protobuf code imports with `.js` extensions, but files are `.ts`

**Solution:** Added to webpack config:
```javascript
resolve: {
  extensionAlias: {
    '.js': ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.jsx'],
  }
}
```

### 2. Package Migration
Migrated from deprecated `@bufbuild/*` to `@connectrpc/*`:
- `@bufbuild/connect` → `@connectrpc/connect`
- `@bufbuild/connect-web` → `@connectrpc/connect-web`
- `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-connect-es` → `@connectrpc/protoc-gen-connect-es`

### 3. Local Plugin Generation
Changed buf to use locally installed npm packages instead of remote plugins, avoiding network dependencies during build.

## Benefits of New Setup

1. **Full Control:** Custom webpack config vs black box react-scripts
2. **Modern Tooling:** Latest TypeScript, webpack, React versions
3. **Better Performance:** Optimized production builds with code splitting
4. **Easier Debugging:** Source maps and better error messages
5. **Maintainable:** Clear build process, documented configuration
6. **Docker-Ready:** Multi-stage build working correctly

## Migration Notes

For future services that need web clients:
1. Copy `web-client/` directory as template
2. Update `buf.gen.yaml` to point to new service proto files
3. Update imports in `App.tsx` for new service client
4. Regenerate with `npm run proto`
5. Build with `npm run build`
